* add more rspec examples (+ nil and boolean attributes)

* add: changed? all.changed? any.changed? one.changed? none.changed? to attrquery and query proxies
  - they can use methods that internally are checking it

add Order filter
  * add reverse
  * add random

add Pick filter
  * add step
  * add head
  * add tail
  * add regex/slice

* automagically include filters from common_filters subdirectory

* improve filter_attributes - make it use some table that holds filtering methods that are actually in use (ordered)

* add sanitize to common filters (that calls needed filtering methods depending on attribute name)
  -- sanitize_email
  -- sanitize_url
  -- sanitize_string
  -- sanitize_name
  -- sanitize_country
  -- sanitize_iban (future, in a gem attribute-filters-common-iban)

  sanitize_the_attribute :name
  sanitize_the_attribute :name => { :as => :name }
  the_attribute :name, :should_be_sanitized
  the_attribute :name, :should_be_sanitized => { :as => :name }

add some sugar:

  the_attribute :name, :shoud_be => { :downcased, :squeezed }
